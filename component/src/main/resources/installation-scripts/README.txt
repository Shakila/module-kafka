Instructions for usage

This guide contains instructions to install the Kafka ballerina package into your ballerina installation. This is a one-time task.
Once done, you can then use this package across all your ballerina projects.

In this directory, you can find two scripts of interest to you.

1. install.{sh/bat} - Installs the Kafka package.
2. uninstall.{sh/bat} - Uninstalls the Kafka package if installed already.

Happy coding!
